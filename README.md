# Pixyll

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
Based on [Pixyll for Jekyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll)

## Image

to use images in the posts you need:

`{{% img src="filename" alt="description" width="620" height="324"  %}}`


Keep in mind that beause of the lack of features in Hugo this is the best way to insert images without having to worry about incopatibility in AMP. The native markdown is not suppported for now.
